# 16-bit-risc-processor
>A 16-bit Reduced Instruction Set Computing(RISC) processor designed using the Verilog harware description language(HDL). The design was implemented on a Nexys 4 DDR board using the Xilinx Artix-7 Field Programabble Gate Array(FPGA). The processor is capable of fetching and executing a set of 16-bit machine instructions.
